PART 1:

Prompt 1:
"Build me a complete, working Tic-Tac-Toe that runs in a web browser. 
Make it a single HTML file that I can just open and use. 
Include all the JavaScript and CSS needed."

Notes 1:
It seems to be working, attempting to break the program seems difficult as I have yet to find a way to do so.

____________
Prompt 2:
"Add a light mode toggle to the left of the "Export HTML" button at the bottom of the application."

Notes 2:
ChatGPT generated a the new code (I forgot to ask it to keep the original code) and the "vs Computer" toggle no longer seems to be working. Also a lot of the instructions and tips are now missing.

____________
Prompt 3:
"Could you add the dark/light mode toggle to the first HTML code without removing or changing it?"

Notes 3:
It did not keep any of the original format of the first atempt, though nothing seems to be broken.

____________
Prompt 4:
"Without changing the appearance, layout, or functionality of the current features, add a vs computer toggle"

Notes 4:
Everything is working fine, but the vs computer is very easy to beat and seems to have little to no stratagy.

____________
Prompt 5:
"Without changing its current appearance, make the "vs computer" smarter."

Notes 5:
The program seems to be working perfectly, and the "vs computer" is a lot smarter. I am not good at Tic-Tac-Toe to begin with so I am unsure if it is too difficult.

PART 2:

Notes:
After asking it to explain Single Page Applications and their frameworks, it recommended for me to use react. I was confused on what to do with the code it gave me at first, but it also recommended I use CodeSandbox.io to run it, after doing so and clicking a square it gives me a ReferenceError "checkWin is not defined".

PART 3:

What you learned:
The AI, in some instances, can generate working code but has difficulty changing it unless you are very specific; even then it can sometimes do things you don't want or break the code.
